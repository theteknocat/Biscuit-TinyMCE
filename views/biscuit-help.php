		<h4>What is Tiny MCE?</h4>
		<p>Tiny MCE is a word processor-like rich text editor that lets you edit content in a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) format. It provides a toolbar of formatting options and functions similar to word processors you may already be familiar with.</p>
		<p>The Tiny MCE editor is used by any modules that have one or more fields that accept rich formatted content, for example the Page Content module.</p>
		<p>This help page provides a guide on how to perform the basic tasks in Tiny MCE. If you require more in-depth help, please contact your web developer to arrange a training session.</p>
		<h4>The Editor</h4>
		<p><img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/editor-example.jpg"></p>
		<p>This example shows the standard toolbar typically offered by most modules that use Tiny MCE. It provides the majority of formatting tools and functions required to do almost everything you need, without compromising the consistency of styles your web developer programmed in to your site.</p>
		<p>Try playing around with the formatting functions available in the toolbar to get a feel for how it works. Here's a quick reference of all the toolbar buttons shown in the above example. The additional help tabs above provide details on some of the more complex, but common, functions.</p>
		<h4>Button/Control Reference</h4>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> This only covers the buttons and controls usually available by default. If you have additional controls and you're not sure what they are for, please contact your web developer for additional help.</p>

	<div id="help-links">
		<h4>Basics</h4>
		<p>To make any text, or an image, into a link, select it with the mouse (for text, click and drag the cursor to select all the text you want to make into a link), then click the link button (<img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/toolbar-buttons/link-button.gif" style="vertical-align: bottom;" alt="Link button">) in the toolbar.</p>
		<p>To edit an existing link, click on the text or image that is already linked and then click the link button (<img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/toolbar-buttons/link-button.gif" style="vertical-align: bottom;" alt="Link button">) in the toolbar.</p>
		<p>To remove a link without deleting the content, click on the text or image that is linked and then click the unlink button (<img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/toolbar-buttons/unlink-button.gif" style="vertical-align: bottom;" alt="Unlink button">) in the toolbar.</p>
		<h4>The Link Dialog</h4>
		<p>When you click the toolbar button to add or edit a link, you will be presented with this dialog:</p>
		<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/link-dialog.gif" alt="Link Dialog"></p>
		<p>You can insert a link from this dialog in several ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Type or Paste URL</strong><br>
				Type the URL in manually, or copy and paste it. This is necessary if creating a link to an external website - you need to put in the full URL starting with "http://"</li>
			<li><strong>Select from the Link List</strong><br>
				<img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/link-list-dropdown.gif" alt="Link list example"><br>
				To insert a link to another page of the site, or another internal resource, click on the link-list drop-down and select the desired item. This will insert a special link that will automatically update properly if the page or item is renamed.</li>
			<li><img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/browse-button.gif" alt="Browse for media" style="vertical-align: middle;"> <strong>Browse for a File</strong><br>
				Clicking the browse button will open a dialog to the file manager, where you can upload files from your computer and select one to use for the link. See the "File Manager" help tab above for more information.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Other Options</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Target</strong><br>
				Optionally choose how you want the link to open - in the same window, or a new one. The default is to open in the same window.</li>
			<li><strong>Title</strong><br>
				Optionally set title text. This will appear in a tooltip when you mouse over the link, and will be picked up by search engines and screen readers. You should always set a title for image links to help the user know where it will take them.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="help-images">
		<h4>Basics</h4>
		<p>To insert an image, place the text cursor where you want to insert the image and click the image button (<img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/toolbar-buttons/image-button.gif" style="vertical-align: bottom;" alt="Image button">) in the toolbar.</p>
		<p>To update an existing image, click on the image to select it then click the image button (<img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/toolbar-buttons/image-button.gif" style="vertical-align: bottom;" alt="Image button">) in the toolbar.</p>
		<h4>The Image Dialog</h4>
		<p>When you click the toolbar button to insert or update an image, you will be presented with this dialog:</p>
		<p style="text-align: center"><img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/image-dialog.gif" alt="Image Dialog"></p>
		<p>You can insert an image in one of two ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Type or Paste URL</strong><br>
				Type the URL in manually, or copy and paste it, if the image you want to insert is from another website. Note that the owner of the other website will not likely appreciate you linking to their image directly. It's better to download a copy and upload it to your site - making sure you are not violating any copyrights.</li>
			<li><img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/browse-button.gif" alt="Browse for media" style="vertical-align: middle;"> <strong>Browse for a File</strong><br>
				Clicking the browse button will open a dialog to the file manager, where you can upload images from your computer and select one to use. See the "File Manager" help tab above for more information.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Other Options</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Image Description</strong><br>
				This provides search engines and screen readers with a description of the image. It also appears as a tooltip to users when they mouse over the image, except when the image is a link, in which case the link title will be used as the tooltip instead.<br><br>We recommended always filling this out as accurately as you can.</li>
			<li><strong>Alignment</strong><br>
				Optionally select the way the image should be aligned in relation to the text.</li>
			<li><strong>Dimensions</strong><br>
				It is best to always leave this field blank. If you set the dimensions of the image, the web browser will make sure the image is displayed at the specified size, which can produce bad results such as stretching/pixelating. Leaving this blank will display the image in it's native size. If you are using the Biscuit File Manager, you will be able to choose among the available default image sizes, so you can choose the one that best fits. You can also pre-size the image before you upload it to ensure that it will appear in the right size when you insert it. In addition, you can ask your web developer to setup some pre-set image sizes that you will commonly want to use. These will then be available to choose from in the Biscuit File Manager. Please contact your web developer to discuss this option or get more detailed help with image sizing.</li>
			<li><strong>Border</strong><br>
				Optionally set the size of border you want applied to the image. The border colour will always be black.</li>
			<li><strong>Vertical and Horizontal space</strong><br>
				Setting values in these fields will add margin to the top and bottom (vertical) or sides (horizontal) of the image. Note that these margins may get overridden by the theme your web developer programmed. If that's the case, please contact your developer for help with how to add spacing around images.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> In addition to the border and spacing options available in the image dialog, you can ask your developer to provide you with special custom styles, if desired, that you can apply to images by selecting them from the "Styles" drop-down in the editor toolbar. For example, if you want some images to have a coloured border, or you want to be able to apply several style/layout options with a single click. Contact your developer if you are interested in such options.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="help-pasting">
		<p>Most content that you copy from somewhere else can simply be pasted into the Tiny MCE editor using the normal paste keyboard shortcut (CTRL-V in Windows, CMD-V in Mac OS). However, if you copied the content from a source that is not plain text, such as another website or a word processor like Microsoft Word, the styles from the source content may get pasted as well. This can interfere with your website's styles by introducing inconsistencies that can range from a minor annoyance to a major breakage.</p>
		<p>To work around this problem, there are two special paste buttons in the toolbar:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/toolbar-buttons/paste-from-word.gif" alt="Paste from Word" style="vertical-align: middle;"> <strong>Paste from Word</strong><br>
				Clicking this button opens a special dialog with a text box into which you can paste the content you copied from Microsoft Word. After pasting, while most Word styles will have been removed there may still be some unwanted coding from Word. You can easily remove this, as well as tidy up the formatting a bit, in the dialog before you insert the text into your content.<br>
				<img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/paste-from-word-dialog.gif" alt="Paste from word"></li>
			<li><img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/toolbar-buttons/paste-as-plain-text.gif" alt="Paste as Plain Text" style="vertical-align: middle;"> <strong>Paste as Plain Text</strong><br>
				When you click on this button, the normal paste function will switch to plain text mode. You will be notified of this when you click the button. Once the button is highlighted, anything you paste will be pasted as plain text with any of it's original styling removed. This is the best option to use if you are copying and pasting content from another web page. When you have finished using plain text paste mode, click the button again to switch back to normal paste mode.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="help-file-manager">
		<p>Clicking on the file browse button (<img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/browse-button.gif" style="vertical-align: bottom;" alt="File browse button">) in an image or link dialog will open a popup window with the File Manager where you can upload files from your computer and select one to insert.</p>
		<?php
		if ($Biscuit->module_exists('FileManager')) {
			?>
		<p>Your website is using the Biscuit File Manager. Please <a href="/user-help/FileManager">visit the Biscuit File Manager help page</a> for detailed usage information.</p>
			<?php
		} else {
			?>
		<p>Your website is using the Tiny Browser file manager. Please consult your web developer about upgrading to the new Biscuit File Manager, which is far more user friendly.</p>
		<h4>Browsing Files</h4>
		<p>The Tiny Browser file manager is setup to keep your images separate from other types of files. As such, if you are browsing for an image to insert, you will only be able to see image files. If browsing to insert a link to any kind of file, you will see all types of files including images. However, depending on how your developer setup your site, images may be kept in a completely separate folder from other files.</p>
		<p>When browsing for images the file manager will offer you the thumbnail view by default with a drop-down above the thumbnails to switch to list view if desired. Browsing for any other files offers list view only with no option to switch to thumbnail view.</p>
		<p><strong>List View:</strong><br>
			<a href="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/tinybrowser/browse-list-view.gif" rel="browse-views" class="lightbox" title="List View"><img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/tinybrowser/browse-list-view-sml.gif" alt="Browse list view"></a></p>
		<p><strong>Thumbnail View:</strong><br>
			<a href="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/tinybrowser/browse-thumb-view.gif" rel="browse-views" class="lightbox" title="Thumbnail View"><img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/tinybrowser/browse-thumb-view-sml.gif" alt="Browse thumbnail view"></a></p>
		<p>When browsing images, hovering over an image in thumbnail view shows a tooltip with detailed information. Hovering over an image in list view shows a tooltip with the thumbnail. When browsing other types of files, hovering over a file shows the filename only.</p>
		<p>To select the file you want to insert as a link or image, just single-click on the desired file. The file manager will close and the file's URL will be entered into the image or link URL field.</p>
		<p>To change the current folder, click the desired folder on the left.</p>
		<h4>Uploading Files</h4>
		<p>If you have permission to upload files, you will see an "Upload" tab at the top of the file manager. If you have Flash Player installed you will see the Flash uploader:</p>
		<p><a href="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/tinybrowser/upload-view.gif" class="lightbox" title="Upload Page With Flash"><img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/tinybrowser/upload-view-sml.gif" alt="Upload page"></a></p>
		<p>When you click the "Browse" button you'll be able to select multiple files to upload. Once you have selected files from your computer that you wish to upload, they will appear in the list above the upload button. You can remove any files you don't want to upload, or add more files. When satisfied, click the "Upload" button. You will see a progress bar at the bottom during the upload process. When done, the page will refresh.</p>
		<p>If you do NOT have Flash Player installed, you will see a standard upload form:</p>
		<p><a href="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/tinybrowser/upload-view-noflash.gif" class="lightbox" title="Upload Page Without Flash"><img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/tinybrowser/upload-view-noflash-sml.gif" alt="Upload page"></a></p>
		<p>You can use this form to upload one file at a time. Once you click the "Upload" button you must wait until it is complete before doing anything else. Google Chrome will show upload progress at the bottom of the browser window, but other browsers may not indicate progress so you must simply be patient until it is complete.</p>
		<p>Once you have finished uploading files, go back to the "Browse" tab to select one you wish to use.</p>
		<h4>Modifying Files</h4>
		<p>If you have permission to modify files, you will see an "Edit" tab at the top of the file manager. This provides various functions for modifying files, including renaming, moving and deleting:</p>
		<p><a href="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/tinybrowser/edit-view.gif" class="lightbox" title="Edit File Page"><img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/tinybrowser/edit-view-sml.gif" alt="Edit file page"></a></p>
		<p>"Delete" is the default action when you go to the edit page. Click on the "Action" drop-down to select other functions. The selected function will provide functions next to each file in the list, as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Delete</strong><br>
				Provides a checkbox next to each file. Check all the files you want to delete, then click the "Delete Files" button at the bottom of the file list.</li>
			<li><strong>Rename</strong><br>
				Provides a text field next to each file containing the file name. Make changes to any files you want to rename, then click the "Rename Files" button at the bottom of the file list.</li>
			<li><strong>Move</strong><br>
				Provides a "Destination" drop-down next to the "Action" drop down, along with checkboxes next to each file. Choose a destination folder from the drop-down, check each file you want to move into that folder, then click the "Move Files" button at the bottom of the file list.</li>
			<li><strong>Resize</strong> (available ONLY when browsing image files)<br>
				Provides a text field next to each file along with a drop-down to choose "width" or "height". For every image you want to resize, enter the desired new size in pixels into the text field and select which dimension to apply it to. The other dimension will be sized proportionally. Click the "Resize Files" button at the bottom of the file list.</li>
			<li><strong>Rotate</strong> (available ONLY when browsing image files)<br>
				Allows rotating images 90 degrees left or right. Provides radio buttons next to each image to select which way to rotate, or none. Select the rotation direction for all images you want to rotate, then click the "Rotate Files" button at the bottom of the file list.</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Managing Folders</h4>
		<p>If you have permission to manage folders, you will see a "Folders" tab at the top of the file manager window. This will list all folders in their hierarchy and provide functions to create, delete or rename:</p>
		<p><a href="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/tinybrowser/folder-view.gif" class="lightbox" title="Manage Folders Page"><img src="/extensions/tiny_mce/images/help/tinybrowser/folder-view-sml.gif" alt="Manage folders page"></a></p>
		<p>Selecting the desired operation from the "Action" drop-down will provide you with the means to perform each function as follows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Create</strong><br>
				Provides a text field next to each existing folder where you can enter a name for a new folder you wish to create within that folder. Enter a name for each new folder you want to create and click the "Create Folders" button at the bottom of the list.</li>
			<li><strong>Delete</strong><br>
				Provides a checkbox next to each folder you can delete, except for the main folder. Check all folders you want to delete then click the "Delete Folders" button at the bottom of the list. <strong>Note: </strong> it will not allow you to delete folders that contain files, but will only warn you about this when you try to delete one. You must therefore make sure you have deleted all files and sub-folders before hand.</li>
			<li><strong>Rename</strong><br>
				Provides a text field next to each folder in which you can enter a new name, except for the main folder. Change the name of any folder you want to and then click the "Rename Folders" button at the bottom of the list.</li>
		</ul>
